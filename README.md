# GTA-Downloader
Hi, this is my version of GTA Downloader. This project was made public due to the following reasons:
- People who are interested in the programming.
- If one is afraid that is a virus, one can browse the code.
- To build my portfolio.

I would like to mention that I've just started my journey with C# and so not everything is perfectly coded. I will be gradually improving the code.

Due to the fact that I have to use a private API key to access the Google drive API, I've removed the key from FileData -> service. To acquire such key follow the steps below.

Steps to get API key:
1. General info: https://www.daimto.com/google-drive-authentication-c/ -> the part that interests you is: https://gyazo.com/722acbd29ff1adcc6f9956f666486d9d
2. visit  https://console.developers.google.com
3. Create new project, name it w/e you want, go to "Credentials" -> "Create Credentials" -> choose API key -> you will get a key, copy and paste it into FileData -> service in "ApiKey", then in ApplicationName, name it w/e you want.
4. Start debugging, everything should be working.

I will be constatly updating this project so stay tuned!
